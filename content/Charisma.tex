\section{Charisma}

This is far too important to be in a separate project, needs to be included in the main notes.
This section will have the major lessons of charisma, some tricks to get along with people better.

This, specially for people that spend the majority of their time sitting in a chair with themselves learning... it can be difficult to interact properly with other people. Some tips are always welcome and many many of the things we do have an implicit meaning for the other people that we are not aware of because we have just been on the side that says that.

\subsection{Good Manners}
\subsubsection{At Table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wash your fucking hands.
    \item Don't ask for the check while you haven't finished... It will seem that you want to leave;
    \item If you want to pay, do that quietly. Go to the counter and do that discretely.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Languages \& Cultures}

Different languages, different cultures. You should feet the cultures! If you can speak german, you'll climb so much in a german's consideration!


\subsection{German}

If the person somewhat young or has a street feel, learn some slang ;)
